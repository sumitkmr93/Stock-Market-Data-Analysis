# stock-market-data-analysis

  The  objective  of  this  assignment  was  to collect  a  dataset  from  one  or  more  open  web APIs of our choice, and use Python to   pre-process and analyse the collected data.  

  The  assignment  was required to  be  implemented  as  a  single  IPython  Notebook  (not  a  script). The  code  was required  be         clearly  documented,  using  comments  and  Markdown  cells  to explain the code and results.

# The Tasks that were assigned are as follows:

  1. Choose  one  or  more  open  web  APIs  as  your  source  of  data.  If  you  decide  to  use more than one API, the APIs should be        related in some way.

  2. Collect data from your chosen API(s) using Python. Your dataset should contain at least 100 records/items in total. Depending on the      API(s), you may need to repeat the collection process multiple times to download sufficient data. 

  3. Parse the collected data, and store it in an appropriate file format for subsequent analysis (e.g. JSON, CSV, XML). 

  4. Load  and  represent  your  data  as  a  Pandas  DataFrame.  Apply  any  pre-processing and quality checking steps that may be            required to clean and filter the data before analysis. 

  5. Analyse  and  summarise  the  cleaned  dataset,  using  tables  and  plots  where appropriate.  Based  on  your  results,  what            interpretations  or  insights  can  be  made about  the  dataset?  What  further  analysis  might  be  done  on  the  data?  Detail        this using Markdown cells in your notebook

# Tasks Completed

  1. Extracted Data from the QUANDL API using Python, parsed the data and stored it in JSON Format, then represented the data using
     Pandas Library.
  2. Performed Pre-processing and quality checking steps, then analysed and summarised the cleaned dataset. Used various plots
     (Candlestick plot, Relative Strength Index, Moving Average Convergence Divergence) to represent the data using Matplotlib
     Library.
  3. Based on the results, interpretations or insights were made about the dataset.
